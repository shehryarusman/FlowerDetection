    "In this blog-post we discuss the concept of transfer-learning and show an implementation in Python, using tensorflow. Namely, we are using the pre-trained model *MobileNetV2* and apply it on the *Oxford Flower 102* dataset, in order to build a flower classification model. Lastly, we deploy the trained model on an ios device to make live predictions, using the phone's camera. The Github Repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/paulmora-statworx/flower_detection).\n",

    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of transfer-learning is best understood when applied to real-life examples. If, for example, a person has played the piano for many years, this person will have an easier time picking up guitar, compared to a person who never played any musical instrument before.\n",
    "\n",
    "That does not imply, of course, that the person who has prior piano experience is going to be perfect at playing the guitar right away, but the yearslong finger practice of playing piano and the development of having a good ear in music makes it easier for that person to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that these synergy effect were only possible because playing piano and playing the guitar were somewhat related. If the person who played piano for many years is now trying to learn to play American Football, it is rather less likely that this person will have an advantage. Hence, whether the previous training of concept A is beneficial for concept B depends on whether concept A and B bear any similarities to oneanother.\n",
    "\n",
    "The very same idea applies to transfer-learning. Let us assume that we have a model which is very strong in detecting whether an apple is portrayed in a given image. Chances are good that we could use this model to detect pears as well, since pears and apples are similar (both round fruits). It will definitely not be as strong as a model thst was trained entirely on pears, but in situation where we do not have that many trainings images of pears, it is better than nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "That the apple detection would work also on detecting pears is only because apples and pears bear some common characteristics, like for example color and shape. If we would, on the other hand, take the apple detection model and try to detect cars with it, we will likely have terrible performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question might arise why we are not simply building one model for each job: one model for detecting apples, one model for detecting pears, and so on.  The reason why this is sometimes not feasible are multi-fold. It could be, for example, that we lack the computational power, the time, or even the amount of images needed to train a  classification model that performs well. Especially the latter reason is a common problem within image detection."

    "The reason why a small amount of images leads to a poor performing model is easily understood when considering the workings of a neural network. When initializing a neural network, all weight parameters are initialized randomly. Through the training process these weight parameters are constantly adjusted, using back-propagation based on gradient descent. If we do not have enough images of the object we would like to classify, the network is not going to have a sufficient amount of data in order to adjust the weights appropriately (i.e., learn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer-learning can help in those situations. That is because of the workings of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are the gold standard when working with image data. While many details of CNNs are not fully explored, it is established that especially the lower levels of those models learn general shapes and patterns of the images. In the final layers of the networks all these shapes and patterns are put together to make up for the final object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a pre-trained model on a different domain than it was originally trained for, we cannot make use of the top-layers of the pre-trained model since they are too specific to the initial use-case. The lower-levels of the network, on the other hand, come in very handy since detecting shapes and patterns is an essential part of image recognition, as is going to be needed for the new domain as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we simply separate the pre-trained model into two pieces. The first piece, the layers below the very top are referred to as the **base-model**. The job of these layers is to detect shapes and patterns and putting them together into a combination of these intial shapes and patterns. The second piece is the top-layers. These layers are specific to the objects the model is classifying. This second piece is unwanted when changing the domain the model is supposed to classify, and therefore simply removed. Afterwards we stack on top of the base-model, one or several untrained layers, which comply with the number of categories we would like to classify within the new domain. That means, if the pre-trained model was originally trained to classify 50 different dog breeds, we can remove the last dense layer which outputs a vector with length 50, and add a layer with 30 categories, in order to classify 30 different cat breeds."

We achieve that by freezing the weights of the base-model and therefore only training the newly added top layer with image data from the new domain. That is because jointly training the pre-trained model with the randomly initialized top-layers would result in gradient updates that are too large, and the pre-trained model would forget what it originally learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through that approach the model is much faster in correctly classifying the objects from the new domain, since it does not spend time with learning how to detect shapes and patterns, but solely on how to identify what the combination of such shapes and patterns represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the top-layers we then can go one step further and train the entire model a bit more, by unfreezing some top-layers of the base-model and re-training those as well. It is crucial at this point to use a smaller learning rate, in order to not cause large gradient updates which would shake the foundation of the model."

For that we first have to find a solid pre-trained model. As explained above, it is important for the cross-learning effects to happen that the pre-trained model is generalizable. Therefore, most of these pre-trained models are initially trained on very large image datasets with hundreds of categories. For that reason, many of the pre-trained models are trained using the [ImageNet database](https://www.image-net.org). This database offers 1000 categories and over one million training images.\n",

    "When choosing which pre-trained model to go for, we were influenced in our decision by the fact that we are interested in deploying our final model on a mobile device. This causes obvious limitations in storage space, processing speed and energy usage, due to the decreased capactities of mobile phones. Lucky for us, there is a pre-trained model for exactly that purpose, namely the [**MobileNet V2**]((https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf)), which was developed by Google.\n",

The size of the feature maps being passed from one layer to the next, are denoted by the variable *c*, while the stride parameter is denoted as *s*. The parameter *t* describes the *expansion factor*, which is the amount by which the number of channels are expanded within the bottleneck methodology.\n",

    "To better understand that, we quickly explain the workings of traditional convolution. Traditional convolution applies one (usually) squared kernel to an image, which then calculates the dot product with every feature map respectively and then calculates a weighted sum of all dot product results in return one single number. The resulting number of feature maps when applying a kernel to an image is equal to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying depth wise convolution, we still apply the kernel to the image and calculate the dot product for every feature map. The difference is that we are then not summing the results of *all* feature maps together, but rather only sum the dot products for each feature map individually. This approach results in us having the same amount of feature maps before and after applying the convolution. This is also visible by looking at the second row of the table above, in which it says that both the input and output are equal to $tk$."

The reason for this is mainly already answered by the invention of [MobileNetV1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf). In contrast to MobileNetV2, V1 consists only of the depth wise convolution plus the projection layer. This combination is by the original paper referred to as **Depth wise separable convolution**.\n",

    "$$D_K \\cdot D_K \\cdot M \\cdot N \\cdot D_F \\cdot D_F$$\n",

    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to traditional convolution, depth wise convolution does not take the number of output channels into consideration, since it creates as many output channels as it has input channels by definition. Adjusting the number of output channels is then conducted by the projection layer. Both costs are then in the end summed together, resulting in the computational cost of the depth wise separable convolution: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_K \\cdot D_K \\cdot M \\cdot D_F \\cdot D_F + M \\cdot N \\cdot D_F \\cdot D_F$$\n",

    "N &= \\textrm{Number of output channels} \\\\\n",
    "D_F &= \\textrm{Feature map size} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When then calculating how many times the depth wise separable convolution is superior to the traditional convolution, we find the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{D_K \\cdot D_K \\cdot M \\cdot D_F \\cdot D_F + M \\cdot N \\cdot D_F \\cdot D_F}{D_K \\cdot D_K \\cdot M \\cdot N \\cdot D_F \\cdot D_F} = \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{1}{D^2_K}$$\n",

    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a Kernel size of 3, we then find that the convolution method of MobileNet is 8 to 9 times more efficient compared to traditional convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computation gains are the main motivation of using MobileNet overall. The difference between V2 and V1 are mostly the idea of zipping and unzipping the image within each bottleneck sequence, which further reduces the computational costs.  "

These steps are outlined in the methods <code> _loading_images_array </code> and <code> _load_labels </code>. Since labels and images are stored within two separate files, we have to make sure to correctly align and match image and label. This is done by sorting the image names in an ascending order before attaching the labels. The labels have to be one-hot encoded, in order to be properly used within the prediction algorithm.\n",

This is necessary since the input images have to resemble the same kind of images which were used when training the model in the first place.\n",

In contrast to the training data, the validation and test data is not augmented in any way other than the necessary MobileNetV2 pre-processing. Classifying the flower category becomes a much harder challenge for the model when the image is heavily augmented. Since the validation data is not altered in any way, those examples are much easier for the model, which results in a better performance of on the validation data in contrast to the training data, a phenomena which rarely occurs."

We see that all images are much darker than the original ones we saw before. That change of lighting comes from the MobileNetV2 pre-process function we applied. The image in the very middle of the lower matrix nicely shows the level of distortion we apply to the images. These augmentations of images are especially useful in cases like this one where we have such training little data, since it artificially increases the pool of images we can train our model with. It is to be said, though, that we are not applying these distortions on the test and validation data, since these heavy distortions don't occur in the model's final application and should therefore not be considered in the model's performance on real flower-images.

We see that the model reaches a relatively strong performance after only a small amount of training epochs, but then seems to starting leveling off. After the fine-tuning kicks in, we then witness a significant drop in accuracy, which suggests that the learning rate was probably too high, triggering too large weight changes within the back-propagation of the network. However, after a couple of epochs, the model is back on track, reaching performance levels which were not attainable earlier.\n",

Unsure whether that problem was only due to a potentially higher learning rate, we tried a range of learning rates, always encountering the same problem. We therefore suspect that the drop of the learning rate is likely going to be a result of having so little training data, compared to the example shown on the tensorflow website, which uses the well-known [cats vs. dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).\n",
